Each folder contains the files and examples for a lesson.

# Project

Assuming that you start from the language in this repository, some examples are:
 - extending the language with a new type (floating point numbers, strings, arrays, ...)
 - adding Boolean operators
 - adding the ternary conditional operator `cond ? true_expr : false_expr`

Other projects are certainly good, as long as they involve some (non-trivial) work on the lexer, on the parser, and on the code generation.

Please send your project proposal to Professor Degano and me via e-mail.
